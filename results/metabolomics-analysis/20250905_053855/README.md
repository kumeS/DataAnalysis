# Metabolomics Analysis - September 5, 2025

## Analysis Overview
This folder contains the results of a comprehensive metabolomics analysis performed on September 5, 2025.

## Dataset Information
- **Input file**: fasting.csv
- **Sample size**: 10 samples (5 normal + 5 fasting)
- **Metabolites**: 262+ metabolites analyzed
- **Groups compared**: Normal vs 12-hour fasting conditions

## Analysis Components
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: To identify patterns and group separation
2. **Correlation Analysis**: To understand metabolite relationships
3. **Differential Analysis**: To identify significantly different metabolites between groups
4. **Statistical Summaries**: Comprehensive statistics for all metabolites
5. **Visualization**: Professional publication-ready plots
