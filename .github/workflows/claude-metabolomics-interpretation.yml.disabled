            I have committed new metabolomics analysis results to the repository. Please analyze these results and provide comprehensive scientific interpretation.
            
            The analysis files are located in the latest `results/metabolomics-analysis/` directory and include:
            - analysis_report.md (comprehensive analysis report)
            - summary_stats.csv (statistical summary)
            - pca_plot.png (PCA analysis visualization)
            - correlation_matrix.png (correlation heatmap)
            - heatmap.png (metabolite concentration heatmap)
            - README.md (analysis summary)
            
            Please read these files and provide a detailed scientific interpretation covering:
            
            ## 1. Executive Summary
            - Key findings from the metabolomics analysis
            - Overview of metabolic patterns identified
            
            ## 2. Statistical Analysis & Group Comparisons
            - **Variance Analysis**: Assess within-group and between-group variance patterns
            - **Distribution Analysis**: Examine metabolite concentration distributions and normality
            - **PCA Results**: Variance explanation with statistical significance testing
            - **Correlation Patterns**: Statistical significance and effect sizes
            - **Group Comparisons**: Identify significant differences between conditions
            - **Multiple Testing Corrections**: Adjust for multiple comparisons
            - **Effect Size Assessment**: Quantify magnitude of observed differences
            - **Data Quality Assessment**: Missing data patterns and outlier analysis
            
            ## 3. Discussion & Critical Considerations
            - **Biological Plausibility**: Are findings consistent with known metabolic physiology?
            - **Clinical Relevance**: How do statistical findings translate to practical significance?
            - **Methodological Limitations**: What are the constraints of the analytical approach?
            - **Confounding Factors**: What variables might influence the observed patterns?
            - **Reproducibility Considerations**: How likely are findings to replicate?
            - **Sample Representativeness**: Do results generalize beyond the current dataset?
            - **Statistical Assumptions**: Are the assumptions of applied methods met?
            
            ## 4. Biological Significance
            - Metabolic pathway implications with pathway enrichment analysis
            - Fasting state metabolic profile insights
            - Potential biomarkers identified with validation requirements
            - **Metabolic Network Analysis**: Interconnections between metabolites
            - **Pathway Context**: How findings fit into known metabolic networks
            
            ## 5. Clinical Relevance
            - Health implications of findings with confidence intervals
            - Diagnostic potential with performance metrics
            - Therapeutic insights and intervention targets
            - **Biomarker Performance**: Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values
            - **Clinical Translation Requirements**: Steps needed for clinical application
            
            ## 6. Technical Assessment
            - Data processing quality and validation
            - Statistical validity and assumption checking
            - Methodological strengths/limitations
            - **Power Analysis**: Adequacy of sample size for detected effects
            - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Robustness to analytical choices
            
            ## 7. Recommendations
            - Immediate next steps with statistical priorities
            - Future research directions including power calculations
            - Additional analyses suggested
            - **Validation Study Design**: Recommendations for confirming findings
            - **Sample Size Requirements**: For follow-up studies
            
            Focus on the actual data patterns in the generated files. Create both:
            1. A comprehensive markdown file called 'claude_interpretation.md'
            2. An HTML report called 'claude_interpretation.html' formatted for GitHub Pages viewing
            
            The HTML report should include:
            - Professional styling with CSS
            - Interactive elements where appropriate
            - Proper formatting for web viewing
            - Embedded images and visualizations
            - Table of contents with navigation
            - Responsive design for different screen sizes
            
            Save both files in the same results directory with your comprehensive analysis.
            
            After creating the interpretation files, commit them to the repository with an appropriate commit message.
